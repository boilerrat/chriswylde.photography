# How to Add Buy Button Sales Channel

The Buy Button sales channel might not be visible by default. Here's how to add it:

## Method 1: Add Channel Button

1. On your Sales channels page (where you are now)
2. Look for an **"Add channel"** or **"Add sales channel"** button (usually at the top right or bottom)
3. Click it
4. Look for **"Buy Button"** in the list
5. Click **Add** or **Install**

## Method 2: Direct URL

If the button isn't visible, try going directly to:
```
https://chris-wylde-photography.myshopify.com/admin/sales_channels/buy_button
```

Or navigate to:
- **Settings** → **Sales channels** → Look for "Add channel" → **Buy Button**

## Method 3: Shopify App Store

1. Click the **"Shopify App Store"** button (top right of your Sales channels page)
2. Search for "Buy Button"
3. Install the official Shopify Buy Button app/channel

## Once Buy Button is Added

After adding the Buy Button sales channel:

1. You'll see it in your Sales channels list
2. Click on it to open the Buy Button dashboard
3. Click **"Create Buy Button"**
4. Select **"Product Buy Button"**
5. Choose your product
6. Customize and copy the code

## Note

The Buy Button sales channel is a built-in Shopify feature - you don't need to build a custom app. The documentation you saw is for building custom Shopify apps (like QR code generators), which is much more complex than what you need.

For selling prints on your photography site, the Buy Button embed code is the simplest solution!
